      "question": "What is the cost of treatment?",
      "answer": "The standard cost for our 9-day immersive therapeutic retreat is $9,700. This includes comprehensive preparation and integration support, medical oversight, and a full program of guided treatment sessions designed to promote long-term transformation. We recognize that some highly motivated individuals may not have the financial means to cover the full cost. For this reason, we offer a limited number of need-based financial assistance options to those who demonstrate strong intention and readiness for change. To determine eligibility and receive a personalized cost assessment, we encourage all prospective participants to complete our application form or contact us directly to speak with an intake"

    {
      "question": "Where are you located?",
      "answer": "We are located within the grounds of Hacienda Los Picachos, a private estate on the outskirts of San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. Nestled in the high desert landscape of the central highlands, our facility offers a discreet and tranquil environment that is both restorative and conducive to deep personal work. The hacienda provides a secure and serene setting, surrounded by open skies, native flora, and panoramic views of the surrounding mountains. While just a short drive from the cultural and historical center of San Miguel—a UNESCO World Heritage Site—our location remains intentionally secluded, allowing for a sense of containment and focus during your stay. Our treatment spaces are thoughtfully designed to balance simplicity and comfort. You’ll find quiet areas for reflection, private accommodations, and access to nature—all contributing to an experience that supports both psychological depth and physical recovery.This setting plays an important role in the therapeutic process. By removing the distractions of everyday life and placing you in an environment that feels safe, grounded, and separate from your usual context, we create the conditions necessary for meaningful transformation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where can I get an EKG?",
      "answer": "We ask that you please send us an EKG no more than three months old prior to arrival. Your GP should be able to write a request for this that you can then take to a lab for the test. If you do not have a GP, most walk-in clinics can provide one upon request. Please note: we require the full print-out of the test, not just the physician’s interpretation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where can I get bloodwork done?",
      "answer": "Our detox protocols require that you have bloodwork done and sent prior to arrival, which includes a complete metabolic panel, including potassium, magnesium, and liver enzymes. Any walk-in lab can usually attend to this and provide results by email. QuestLabs in the United States has a location search feature, where you can find a lab near you."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I have to come off of my drugs/medication?",
      "answer": "There are many drugs and medications that have significant interactions with ibogaine. Some of those medications, including many psychiatric medications, such as SSRI antidepressants, are incompatible with ibogaine, and we require you to taper off of these before arriving at the facility.This is not the case for all medications. Some medications we can manage on-site, even when there are safety concerns, such as opioids and benzodiazepines."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I have to stop drinking alcohol?",
      "answer": "Yes. We require people to stop drinking alcohol for a minimum of 5 days prior to arrival.If you are at risk of experiencing alcohol withdrawals, such as tremors and seizures, this must be managed with medication and the assistance of a physician. We can provide supervised alcohol detoxification on-site at our private facilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I best prepare?",
      "answer": "We provide each participant with access to an ibogaine-informed coach, who serves as a key support figure throughout the preparation and integration process. We strongly recommend engaging with your coach at least four times prior to arrival. These sessions help clarify your intentions, build psychological readiness, and lay the groundwork for a more impactful experience. In addition to one-on-one coaching, you will receive a structured preparatory workbook designed to guide self-inquiry, track progress, and align your internal goals with practical external changes. Your coach will work with you to identify the specific areas of your life you wish to shift—whether that involves securing a new living environment, initiating a fitness routine, adjusting dietary habits, or building healthier relationships.Further preparation recommendations may come from our medical team, especially in cases involving medication adjustments or specific health considerations. Our clinical and therapeutic staff work in close coordination to ensure each participant arrives in an optimal state—physically, emotionally, and psychologically.We’ve found that the more groundwork you establish prior to treatment, the more effectively you can anchor the insights and transformation that often follow. To support this continued evolution, we provide three months of post-treatment integration, including weekly sessions, to help solidify the progress made during your stay and carry it forward into daily life."
