    question: "Where can I get an EKG?",
    answer:
      "We ask that you please send us an EKG no more than three months old prior to arrival. Your GP should be able to write a request for this that you can then take to a lab for the test. If you do not have a GP, most walk-in clinics can provide one upon request. Please note: we require the full print-out of the test, not just the physician’s interpretation.",

    question: "Where can I get bloodwork done?",
    answer:
      "Our detox protocols require that you have bloodwork done and sent prior to arrival, which includes a complete metabolic panel, including potassium, magnesium, and liver enzymes. Any walk-in lab can usually attend to this and provide results by email. QuestLabs in the United States has a location search feature, where you can find a lab near you.",

    question: "Do I have to come off of my drugs/medication?",
    answer:
      "There are many drugs and medications that have significant interactions with ibogaine. Some of those medications, including many psychiatric medications, such as SSRI antidepressants, are incompatible with ibogaine, and we require you to taper off of these before arriving at the facility.This is not the case for all medications. Some medications we can manage on-site, even when there are safety concerns, such as opioids and benzodiazepines.",

    question: "Where can I get bloodwork done?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We require people to stop drinking alcohol for a minimum of 5 days prior to arrival.If you are at risk of experiencing alcohol withdrawals, such as tremors and seizures, this must be managed with medication and the assistance of a physician. We can provide supervised alcohol detoxification on-site at our private facilities.",

    question: "Where can I get bloodwork done?",
    answer:
      "We provide everyone who comes to our facilities with access to an ibogaine-informed coach who we recommend that you meet with at least 2 times prior to arrival, and continue to meet with after you leave our facility. Your coach will help you get to know you and your reasons for taking ibogaine, and help you with practical and psychological preparations before you arrive.Other recommendations for preparation may come from our medical team, and include recommendations regarding medications, diet, etc.In general, we find that our treatments can help to create strong points of change in people’s lives. Working to solidify those changes as much as possible prior to coming can make these transitions much easier. This may include having a new place to stay when you return home, or it may be simpler changes such as implementing a gym routine or diet changes. Whatever it is, your coach will help you to clarify these goals so you can make the most out of your experience.",
